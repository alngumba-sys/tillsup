- Security: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (more than needed)
- Usability: ⭐ (terrible)
- **Overall Value: 3/5** (secure but unusable)

**AFTER (4 characters):**
- Combinations: 1,048,576
- Perfect for temporary password
- Security: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (more than adequate)
- Usability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (excellent)
- **Overall Value: 5/5** (secure AND usable)
