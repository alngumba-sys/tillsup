## 🎲 Randomness & Security

### Math:
- **32 characters** available
- **4 positions** to fill
- **32 × 32 × 32 × 32 = 1,048,576** possible passwords

### Security:
- ✅ Over 1 million possible combinations
- ✅ Truly random generation
- ✅ No predictable patterns
- ✅ Temporary use only (must change)
- ✅ One-time use (replaced after change)

### Why It's Secure Enough:
1. **Must be changed immediately** - no prolonged exposure
2. **Internal use only** - not exposed to public
3. **Business context** - shared directly admin-to-staff
4. **Additional security layers** - business isolation, role checks, audit trail
5. **Short lifespan** - typically used within minutes
